# Flutter

The project contains a default app for [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev).

Code is written in [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides).


## Setup and installation

If this is your first time using Flutter, here is a suggestion of how you could set it up. From the
[Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), go through all the
following sections:

- "Get the Flutter SDK"
- "Run flutter doctor"
- "Update your path"
- "Android setup"

After this you should have the following tools installed:

- Git
- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio

Continue to the next step: [Set up an editor](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)
Install the Flutter and Dart plugins.

(Other editors than Android Studio are also possible to use if you prefer).


## Run the app

Open this project in Android Studio. Open the Flutter guide about [Test drive ](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=androidstudio)
and jump to the section "Run the app".

The "Config selector" field will need to be configured. Click on the field, and select "Edit Configurations..".
Click the + button in the top left corner. Select Flutter from the list. In the "Name" field,
enter "main.dart". In the Dart Entrypoint field, find the main.dart file at /itdagene-2022-mobil-app-case-setup-skeleton/flutter/lib/main.dart.

Now you can click "Run "main.dart"", AKA the play button in the toolbar. If everything succeeds you
should see the default Flutter Demo Home Page screen on your device. You have a working Flutter
setup, and you are ready for the case!
